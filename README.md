My invaders game with high score database


Build todos:

:-)Form data is being captured
:-)Now just add playername to playerscore to a player object and pass it to db. 
;-)Check data being collected correctly... console.log data producing at click of restart!


App Todos:  
:-) Highscores to appear at beginning of game, and end  
:-) All players enter initials  
:-) Initials limited to three characters  
:-) Score sent to DB if larger than 5th highest score  
:-) If score is in top 5, then congrats function triggered alongside gameover  
:-) hide all js from browser with closure  
:-) Change game to be more like space-invaders?  
:-) Or, game version with falling divs, but you lose points if enemies hit bottom
